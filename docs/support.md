## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does iScale estimate weight?

iScale uses AI-powered image analysis (OpenAI Vision) to analyze photos of objects and estimate their weight, dimensions, and calorie content. Simply point your camera at an item and tap to analyze.

### How accurate are the estimates?

Estimates are approximate and intended for informational and entertainment purposes. Accuracy depends on image quality, lighting, object visibility, and the type of object. Do not rely on estimates for medical, commercial, or safety-critical purposes.

### Does iScale need an internet connection?

Yes. The AI analysis requires an internet connection to communicate with OpenAI's API.

### Does iScale store my photos?

No. Photos are sent to OpenAI for analysis in real time and are not stored on our servers. See our [Privacy Policy](privacy) for details.

### How do I remove ads?

You can purchase the "Remove Ads" upgrade from within the app via Settings. This is a one-time purchase.

### I purchased Remove Ads but still see ads. What do I do?

Try restoring your purchase from the Settings screen. If the issue persists, make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID used for the purchase, then restart the app.

### How do I request a refund?
