# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** February 26, 2026

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the iScale - AI Scale mobile application ("App") operated by Chad Newbry LLC ("we", "us", or "our").

By using the App, you agree to these Terms.

## Use of the App

iScale uses AI-powered image analysis to provide weight, dimension, and calorie estimates for objects you photograph. These estimates are **for entertainment and informational purposes only** and should not be relied upon for any purpose requiring precise measurements.

## AI-Powered Features

The App uses OpenAI's Vision API to analyze images and generate estimates. By using this feature, you acknowledge that:

- Estimates are approximate and may be inaccurate
- You should not rely on estimates for medical, commercial, legal, or safety-critical purposes
- AI analysis requires an internet connection
- Results depend on image quality, lighting, and object visibility

## In-App Purchases

The App offers a one-time "Remove Ads" purchase through Apple's App Store. All purchases are subject to Apple's terms and conditions. Refund requests should be directed to Apple.

## Intellectual Property

The App and its content are owned by Chad Newbry LLC and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, or distribute the App or its content.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT ESTIMATES WILL BE ACCURATE.

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CHAD NEWBRY LLC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
