# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 26, 2026

Chad Newbry LLC ("we", "us", or "our") operates the iScale - AI Scale mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information We Collect

### Camera Images

The App uses your device camera to photograph objects for AI-powered weight estimation. Photos are sent to OpenAI's API for analysis and are **not stored on our servers**. Photos are processed in real time and discarded after analysis. Please refer to [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) for details on how they handle data sent to their API.

### API Keys

If you provide your own OpenAI API key, it is stored securely in your device's Keychain and is never transmitted to us.

### Purchase Information

If you purchase the "Remove Ads" upgrade, the transaction is handled entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We do not collect or store any payment information. We only receive confirmation of your purchase status.

## Third-Party Services

### Google AdMob

The free version of the App displays ads served by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data for ad personalization and measurement. You can opt out of personalized ads through your device settings. See [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more details.

### OpenAI

Camera images are sent to OpenAI's Vision API for analysis. OpenAI processes these images subject to their [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [API Data Usage Policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).

### Apple StoreKit

In-app purchases are processed by Apple. See [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).
